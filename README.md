# WalletAA

WalletAA is a blockchain wallet analytics platform that tracks EIP-7702 authorization transactions and provides real-time data analysis across multiple blockchain networks.

## üìÇ Project Overview

- **`backend/`** - Contains Python scripts for fetching blockchain data, processing transactions, and managing SQLite databases across multiple networks (Mainnet, Sepolia, OP, Base, BSC)

- **`server/`** - Flask-based API server that provides RESTful endpoints for transactions, authorizers, relayers, and overview statistics with pagination and search capabilities

- **`website/`** - Modern React application built with Ant Design Pro, featuring real-time data visualization, multi-language support, and responsive design
